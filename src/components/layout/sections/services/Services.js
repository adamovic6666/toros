            <h4>Market entry and political risk</h4>
            <p>
              We help companies understand new markets around the world. We
              conduct qualitative research based on conversations with
              decision-makers and sector experts. Recently we have provided
              reports on pharmaceuticals in a major North African market; EU R&D
              policy; the regional politics of a Gulf jurisdiction; and how a
              municipal government in Iberia views foreign investors. We&apos;ve
              also advised UHNWIs on the media landscape around decentralised
              finance, and shaped strategy on establishing a new news service
              covering the industry.

            <h4>Stakeholder mapping</h4>
            <p>
              Gaining an understanding of the main stakeholders in a market or
              sector is crucial for businesses, NGOs, and government
              institutions. Recent work has included reports on major
              stakeholders in EU telecoms, politics and public affairs in the
              Baltics, and gaming in Central Europe.

            <h4>Enhanced due diligence</h4>
            <p>
              Human intelligence-focused enhanced due diligence is at the heart
              of our business. We have recently provided reports on subjects
              including the background of a Ukrainian business figure, the track
              record of a UK-based renewables business, and the ESG performance
              and political ties of a major Austrian company.

          <div>
            <h4>Dispute support</h4>
            <p>
              Sometimes organisations find themselves in difficulties with local
              partners or governments. Toros Advisory can help. We have
              supported clients in bankruptcy cases in regions including the
              Baltics and the Balkans, and provided insights on a â‚¬220m+ deal in
              the Adriatic region that ran into political and legal challenges.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Communications strategy</h4>
            <p>
              With our background in journalism, Toros Advisory also helps
              selected clients with strategic communications, content strategy,
              and editing. We have worked with businesses including law firms,
              white-label publishing outlets, and top PR companies. Recent work
              has included op-ed writing, editing, and communications strategy
              for the launch of a major investment fund, and regular advertorial
              and thought leadership pieces.
